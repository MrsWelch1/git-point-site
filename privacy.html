        <p class="f6 f4-ns gray lh-copy mw7 mb3">
          We're glad you decided to use GitPoint. This Privacy Policy is here to inform you about what we do — and do not do — with
          our user's data.
        </p>

        <h2 class="f3 f2-m f2-l fw7 dark-gray mt5 mb2">
          User Data
        </h2>

        <p class="f6 f4-ns gray lh-copy mw7 mb3">
          We do not do anything with your GitHub information. After authenticating, the user's OAuth token is persisted directly on
          their device storage. It is not possible for us to retrieve that information. We never view a user's access token
          nor store it whatsoever.
        </p>

        <p class="f6 f4-ns gray lh-copy mw7 mb3">
          This means that in no way, shape or form do we ever view, use or share a user's GitHub data. If private data ever becomes
          visible at any point we will not record or view it. If it happens to be accidentally recorded, we will delete
          it immediately using secure erase methods. Again, we've set up authentication specifically so that this never
          happens.
        </p>

        <h2 class="f3 f2-m f2-l fw7 dark-gray mt5 mb2">
          Analytics Information
        </h2>

        <p class="f6 f4-ns gray lh-copy mw7 mb3">
          We currently use Google Analytics and iTunes App Analytics to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the GitPoint.
          These tools collect information sent by your device including device and platform version, region and referrer.
          This information cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual user and no personal information
          is extracted.
        </p>

        <p class="f6 f4-ns gray lh-copy mw7 mb3">
          If we happen to include another third party platform to collect stack traces, error logs or more analytics information, we'll
          make sure that user data remains anonymized and encrypted.
        </p>

        <h2 class="f3 f2-m f2-l fw7 dark-gray mt5 mb2">
          Open Source
        </h2>

        <p class="f6 f4-ns gray lh-copy mw7 mb3">
          GitPoint is open source and the history of contributions to the platform will always be visible to the public.
        </p>

        <p class="f6 f4-ns gray lh-copy mw7 mb3">
          With each contribution to the app, code review is always performed to prevent anybody from including malicious code of any
          kind.
        </p>

        <h2 class="f3 f2-m f2-l fw7 dark-gray mt5 mb2">
